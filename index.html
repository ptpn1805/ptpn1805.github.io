								<p>The main goal of Planty Bot is to create an autonomous robot that can 
									identify a plant pot, go toward it, stop right in the middle of the 
									pot in order to water it, all while being able to avoid objects that are 
									in its path in real time (both statically and dynamically).
									This project is a direct solution to a real world problem, 
									which makes it meaningful and can reach a larger set of audience 
									who struggle with the same issue. With the system that integrates 
									dynamic object avoidance along with computer visioning for location detecting, 
									it has countless possibilities other than watering plants such as storage robot 
									in warehouse that can avoid people in its path, etc.

						<!-- Design -->

								<h2 class="major">Design</h2>
								<h3>Design Criteria: </h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Use computer vision to detect an AR tag and identify it as the final location (the plant pot)</li>
									<li>Use LIDAR sensor to create a shortest path to the pot while avoiding all obstacles based on the sensor inputs </li>
									<li>Stop and turn on water pump when reach desired location</li>
									
								</ul>
								<h3>Base robot choice:</h3>
								<p>We decided to use Turtlebot because it is readily available, has all sensors for collecting needed data, and 
									can handle required movement. Our design choices were actually guided by the setup of the TurtleBot provided 
									for us because of the way the LiDAR sensor and Raspi camera are placed. Since the TurtleBot is only able to move in a 
									2D plane, we had to reconstruct our product and dependencies to only adhere to the x-y plane.
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Turtlebot.png"/></span>
								<h3>Sensor choice:</h3>
								<p>Since we want the product to be as modular as possible, we decided to use the built-in Raspi camera instead of an external
									camera as introduced in class. Doing so can help avoid wiring problems and the robot can be free from 
									environmental dependencies (us holding the external camera or the robot can only move within the camera range if it is mounted up). 
									This built-in camera, however, has very low resolution, so we have to use bigger AR tags as well as be mindful to not put the robot 
									too far from the tags since it needs to detect the AR tags in order to start moving. 
									This creates another problem where having the Turtlebot too close to the pot moves the AR tags out of the camera frame. </p>
								<p>We decided to employ laser detection from the LiDAR sensor to detect objects in front of the Turtlebot instead of using computer 
									vision because it is more simple and straightforward. Since we only need data of how far objects are from the robot, by doing so 
									we can cut down on the bulk of unnecessary work and focus on perfecting the robot movement.
								</p>
								
								<h3>Physical design choice:</h3>
								<p>Since the sensors are in fixed positions, we have to be very mindful in designing the physical outer layer that 
									holds the water bottle and the tube so that it does not obstruct any of the sensors. We decided to make 2 water 
									bottle holders in the back so that the water weight can be evenly distributed. The front is made solid with only 
									an opening for the camera so that we can prevent any water splashing into the robot boards due to the open form 
									factor. The water tube is designed to be as low as possible in order to stay clear from the LiDAR sensor, while 
									still ensuring that the water can be dispensed at the middle of the robot since we program the robot to hit the 
									pot (AR tag) head on. This brings the problem of the water tube being shorter than the AR tag, which hinders the 
									watering process. This can be fixed by making new AR tags with suitable height and recalibrating the camera.

						<!-- Implementation -->
							<article id="implementation">
								<h2 class="major">Implementation</h2>
								<h3>Hardware</h3>
								<p>
									For the most part, we utilized hardware built into the Turtlebot (including the
									Turtlebot itself). We used the LIDAR sensor to detect objects in the Turtlebot's path:
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/LiDAR sensor.jpg"/></span>
								<p>
									We also used the built in Raspberry Pi camera for AR tag tracking:
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/raspi camera.png"/></span>
								<p>
									We also 3D printed a mount for the Turtlebot to allow us to attach the water pump
									and reservoir to the robot. We decided to go with Solidworks 2022 and used CAD to create 
									STL files for 3D printing. We implemented a prototype mount that covers the Turtlebot 
									but leaves space for the raspi camera line of sight. Then the nozzle is placed slightly 
									below the liDAR sensor but tall enough to water a set of potted plants at a fixed height. 
									We then placed water bottles at two corners of the turtleBot for water supply and drew water 
									through a tube using a submersible DC 3V water pump. See additional materials for CAD drawings
									and Solidworks parts.
								</p>
								<h3>Software</h3>
								<p>The software we wrote consisted of two main components: 
									first, we have a ROS node that takes in LIDAR sensor data and filters it so that we only retain 
									the spatial information pertaining to the regions of interest, these being the front, left, and 
									right sides of the Turtlebot. The second node we wrote was the main driver node, which contained 
									all of the logic related to searching for AR tags, driving to them, and used the LIDAR information 
									to perform the obstacle detection algorithm. It uses the ar_track_alvar package to detect AR tags. 
									The ROS graph of our system is shown below:</p>
								<img src="images/ros_graph.jpg" height="500" width="650">

								<p>
									And here is what our LIDAR data and AR tracking data looks like in rviz:
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/LiDar sensor data.png"/></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/AR tracking data.png"/></span>

								<h3>Full System Operation</h3>
								<p>
									First, we need to initialize the camera. By default, the camera outputs a compressed image. 
									To rectify the image, we need to publish our camera’s image as a raw image, thus we feed the 
									compressed image into the image_transport node. Then we rectify the image using the image_proc node. 
									Once we have the camera set up, the Turtlebot will rotate in place searching for the first AR tag to drive to. 
									When it finds the AR tag, it will turn in the direction of it, and begin driving towards it. To account for noisy 
									measurements, imperfections in the robot’s motors, and other external factors, we implemented a feedback 
									control system so that the Turtlebot is able to correct any deviation from its path during driving. 
									If it detects any obstacles in its way while driving (using LIDAR data from the front of the robot only) 
									it will enter an obstacle avoidance sequence.
								</p>
								<p>
									In the obstacle avoidance sequence, it will use LIDAR data to determine open space around the obstacle. 
									It will then determine whether to move to the left or right of the obstacle. If there is space on both sides, 
									it will determine whether the left or right space is closer to the Turtlebot. Once a direction is chosen it 
									will turn in that direction and continue moving until it can no longer detect the object in its path using 
									LIDAR data from the left/right sides (depending on which direction it's moving). Then it will turn back in the 
									direction of the AR tag and continue moving forward. If at any point during this sequence it detects another 
									obstacle, it will perform the same algorithm again. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Finally, once the Turtlebot reaches the plant pot, it will stop for some period of time to 
									water the plant (the watering was not implemented in this project), then reverse and look for the next AR tag to 
									drive to. The process is repeated until all the specified plants have been watered. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Overall, our system is modeled and implemented as a finite state machine which is illustrated below:

							<p>
								Our project was able to track multiple AR tags and orient itself towards the pot plant reliably. 
								Also, it was able to detect and avoid obstacles that are in its way when placed before it in real time.
								When it deviated from its course, it was able to correct itself with the feedback control.
								Below are some of the tasks the project can perform as well as the fully integrated system.

						<!-- Conclusion -->
						<article id="conclusion">
							<h2 class="major">Conclusion</h2>
							<p>Technically, our finished solution is a fair compromise between our design criteria. 
								Since the robot has to detect the AR tag in order to start moving, we can only have 
								dynamic obstacles (obstacles that move into its path) instead of static obstacles 
								that block line of sight to the AR tag. Despite this drawback, we still decided to 
								go with this logic because we are able to get the robot to detect multiple AR tags 
								while still preserving the object detection property of the robot, which makes it 
								more functional in real world usage. In the future, we can combine the current 
								functionality with a strategy where the robot maps the room to take note of static 
								obstacles, and the locations of the AR tags, and can then drive to these tags without 
								seeing them. Once it has line of sight of the AR tag, it can then use the tracking 
								algorithm to position itself more accurately with respect to the pot. We also cannot 
								meet the watering criteria for this project, since we cannot interact with the Raspberry 
								board in order to get the power needed for the power pump. This can be done easily with 
								hardware freedom and our product remains very functional with its core tasks. </p>
							<h3 class="minor">Difficulties</h3>
							<p>While designing, we encountered many problems with the built-in Raspi camera. 
								Calibrating and getting the desired data from this camera was very challenging, as 
								it does not have much documentation online and since it was not used in labs,
								most people we spoke to did not have much experience working with it. 
								Its transformation data is also not so great with different axes than the base frame, 
								so we have to reconstruct the transformations in order to make the math work. </p>
							<p>The LiDAR sensor being fixed at a certain height also poses complications to the objects 
								in which it can detect. If an object does not have relatively uniform size such as a 
								swivel chair, the LiDAR sensor cannot detect the intruding portion of the object that 
								is lower than its laser level, hence making the data faulty. We have to be mindful and 
								use relatively same size objects at all height levels so that the data can be as accurate 
								as possible, which might not be the case for the real world. </p>
							<h3 class="minor">Improvement</h3>
							<p> Being able to prescan the room and import that map into the system would get rid of the 
								limitation of the robot only being able to move after detecting an AR tag, which subsequently 
								makes the robot able to avoid static and dynamic objects alike in real time. Alternatively, 
								we can make the robot go back to its original starting point and memorize the AR tag positions 
								so that it does not need to detect the tags when the sequence is called again. We can also make
								the robot save the positions of the markers, so that it is able to go back to them without line
								of sight after the first time.
